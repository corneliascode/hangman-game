# hangman-game
A simple implementation of the hangman game in Python

I create this script in order to better understand some basic functions in Python. The game is fully usable but just in English, no other languages are available. 
You can use it how the game works or to simply play the game.

## Requirments

**random-word**
It is used in order to randomly select a word from a word database or from online.
More info about it and how to install - https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/

**a large cup of coffee**
because it is much easier to code or to play this game with a cup of coffee :)))
